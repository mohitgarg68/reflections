1>How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

We would look out for signs '-' and '+' before the lines , difference between the lines would help  us find the bug!

2>How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you more efficient programmer in the long term?

This would enable to us to refer to the previous versions of the file so that we can easily debug our current files.

3>What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to commit, like you do it in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros-
	1. You can use your judgement to choose the right size to commit.
	2. You have more control over how commits are managed.
	3. You are quite aware of the logical change sequence in your commits.
Cons-
	1. More prone to user-specific error.

4>Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in a commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Simply because their target audience is different.
